# Project Title

This is a Python 3 implementation of a web scraper to help my wife find a time to take her first CPA exam. Due to COVID-19 and testing location closures, the appointments are booked full, so she'll only be able to get one on short notice. This cronjob will give her a heads up when a nearby testing center has an availability.
